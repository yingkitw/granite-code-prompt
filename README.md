# Prompting with IBM Granite 3 Model for Coding Use Cases

I utilising the latest IBM Granite 3 8B Instruct Model for these coding tasks. This model is lightweight and supports a wide range of programming languages, making it ideal for diverse coding needs. Experiment Objectives The experiment focuses on several key areas, grouped into Code Understanding and Code Generation:

## Code Understanding

- Code Explanation: Break down complex code snippets to make them easier to understand.
- Code Documentation: Automatically generate detailed documentation to keep records up-to-date.
- Code Review: Analyze code for potential improvements and ensure adherence to best practices.

## Code Generation

- Code Improvement: Suggest optimizations to enhance efficiency and performance.
- Code Conversion: Translate code between different programming languages.
- Code Fixing: Identify and resolve bugs or errors in existing code.
- API Generation: Automatically create APIs from given specifications.
- Test Case Generation: Develop test cases to ensure code reliability and performance.
- Diagram Generation: Visualize code structure and workflows through generated diagrams.
